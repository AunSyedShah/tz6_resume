# AI Resume Ranker - Functional Requirements

## 1.2 Proposed Solution

The **AI-powered resume ranking system** automates candidate shortlisting by leveraging **NLP** and intelligent ranking algorithms. The system matches resumes with job descriptions (JDs), reducing manual effort and improving efficiency in candidate selection.

### Workflow
1. **Resume Upload**  
   Applicant uploads a resume (unstructured data).
   
2. **NLP Preprocessing**  
   - Tokenization  
   - Stopword Removal  
   - Stemming  
   - Lemmatization  

   Purpose: Normalize and prepare resume text.

3. **Skill Set Extraction**  
   - Extract technical and domain-specific skills from resumes.  
   - Organize extracted skills into a structured format.  

4. **Job Description Processing (NER)**  
   - Use **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** on JDs.  
   - Identify key expectations: skills, experience, job roles.  

5. **Classification Module**  
   - Classifies resumes based on relevance and alignment with JDs.  

6. **Category-Based Matching**  
   - Compares resumes against job categories.  
   - Ensures most relevant resumes are ranked higher.  

7. **Ranking System**  
   - Integrates classification + matching outputs.  
   - Produces ranked candidate lists for recruiters.  

### Sample Dataset
- **Source:** 228 Word documents (`.docx`), each a resume.  
- **Size:** 24 KB â€“ 90 KB per file.  
- **Content:** Candidate details, skills, education, certifications, work experience.  
- **Profiles:** Full Stack Developers, Business Analysts, Project Managers, Software Engineers.  

Dataset provides the **foundation** for training ML/NLP models.

## 1.2.1 Steps to Build the Model

1. **Resume Dataset Ingestion**  
   - Convert resumes to JSON format.  
   - Extract applicant info: education, experience, skills, certifications.  

2. **Text Preprocessing**  
   - Tokenization  
   - Stopword Removal  
   - Stemming & Lemmatization  

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
   - Extract entities: skills, roles, education, company names.  

4. **Skillset-Based Extraction**  
   - Isolate resumes matching job-required skills.  

5. **Matching Engine**  
   - Compare resumes & JDs.  
   - Calculate **matching score** using:  
     - Keyword overlap  
     - Semantic similarity  
     - Contextual alignment  

6. **Scoring, Ranking & Shortlisting**  
   - Rank candidates based on scores.  
   - Select top candidates above threshold.  

7. **Output to Recruiters**  
   - Display **ranked, filtered list** of best-fit candidates.  
   - Reduce time-to-hire & support **merit-based selection**.
